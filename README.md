# echoes-app
Personal journal/mood tracker app.

Project developed within one of the courses during the first year of a Human-Computer Interaction and Design MSc programe. 
**Disclaimer:** this is a hi-fi prototype, so it is not a fully functional project. 

Users can create and save memories and moods/emotions to later reflect on them.
